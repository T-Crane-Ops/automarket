# Product Requirements Document: UI/UX Enhancement for Account Pages

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the requirements for improving the User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) of key authentication, payment, and user account management pages within the AutoMarket application. The goal is to align these pages visually and experientially with the established design language demonstrated on the main landing page and user dashboard, ensuring a cohesive, modern, and accessible experience across the platform.

**2. Goals**

*   **Visual Consistency:** Unify the look and feel of the target pages (`/login`, `/profile`, `/reset-password`, `/pay`, `/update-password`, `/verify-email`) with the existing design system used in `app/page.tsx`, `app/dashboard/page.tsx`, and `components/landingpage/*`. This includes colors, typography, spacing, component styling (cards, buttons, inputs, alerts), and background treatments.
*   **Enhanced UX:** Improve the intuitiveness, clarity, and overall user satisfaction when interacting with these critical account flows.
*   **Responsiveness:** Ensure all updated pages render correctly and are fully usable across various devices and screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
*   **Accessibility:** Maintain or improve adherence to WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards, ensuring usability for all users, including those using assistive technologies.
*   **Maintain Functionality:** Preserve all existing core functionality of the authentication, profile management, and payment processes.

**3. Non-Goals**

*   Introducing significant new features or changing the core logic of authentication, subscription management, or password recovery.
*   Overhauling the entire application's design system; focus is specifically on the listed pages.
*   Changing API endpoints or backend data structures related to these pages.

**4. User Stories / Requirements**

**4.1. General Requirements (Apply to all target pages)**

*   **GR-1:** As a user, I want all account-related pages to share the same visual style (colors, fonts, component appearance) as the main landing page and dashboard, so the application feels unified.
*   **GR-2:** As a user, I want forms (input fields, labels, buttons) on these pages to follow consistent styling and layout patterns used elsewhere in the application.
*   **GR-3:** As a user, I want interactive elements (buttons, links, inputs) to have clear hover, focus, and active states consistent with the application's design system.
*   **GR-4:** As a user, I want all content and controls on these pages to be clearly readable and usable on my mobile phone, tablet, or desktop computer.
*   **GR-5:** As a user relying on keyboard navigation or screen readers, I want to be able to fully navigate and interact with all elements on these pages.
*   **GR-6:** As a developer, I want page layouts and component usage to leverage the existing design system (Shadcn UI components, custom wrappers, Tailwind utility classes) for maintainability.
*   **GR-7:** As a designer, I want page backgrounds, cards, and containers to adopt the established style (e.g., `bg-background/50`, `backdrop-blur-sm`, `border border-primary/10`, rounded corners) where appropriate.

**4.2. Page-Specific Requirements**

*   **Login Page (`app/login/page.tsx`)**
    *   **LP-1:** Redesign the main `Card` component to use the standard application card style (blurred background, subtle border, consistent padding) instead of `variant="minimal"`.
    *   **LP-2:** Ensure buttons within the `LoginForm` component (Submit, potentially Google Sign-In if customized) adhere to the application's standard button styles (e.g., variants, sizing, rounding).
    *   **LP-3:** Standardize typography (font sizes, weights, colors) for titles, descriptions, labels, and error messages.
    *   **LP-4:** Apply consistent spacing and layout rules.
    *   **LP-5:** Update loading state visual (spinner) to match application standards if different.
*   **Profile Page (`app/profile/page.tsx`)**
    *   **PP-1:** Refactor the main page container and section layout (e.g., Account Management, Subscription Status) to use consistent background treatments, padding, and structure found in the dashboard/landing page sections.
    *   **PP-2:** Restyle the "Subscription Status" container (currently `bg-white dark:bg-gray-800`) using the standard application card style.
    *   **PP-3:** Ensure all buttons (Resubscribe link-as-button, Resume Subscription, Cancel Subscription, modal buttons) use the standard `Button` component variants and styles.
    *   **PP-4:** Update the styling of the cancellation confirmation modal (background, borders, text, buttons) to align with the application's design system for modals.
    *   **PP-5:** Enhance the visual presentation of loading states (e.g., using styled `Skeleton` components) and error messages (e.g., using styled `Alert` components).
    *   **PP-6:** Ensure the `AccountManagement` component's internal styling aligns with the design system.
    *   **PP-7:** Style the payment success notification (`bg-green-50`) to match the application's success alert/notification style.
*   **Reset Password Page (`app/reset-password/page.tsx`)**
    *   **RP-1:** Redesign the main `Card` component using the standard application card style.
    *   **RP-2:** Standardize the styling of `Alert` components (error, success) to match the application's design.
    *   **RP-3:** Ensure all `Button` components use standard variants and styles.
    *   **RP-4:** Ensure the icon usage (`Mail` within the themed circle) is consistent with icon treatments elsewhere.
*   **Payment Page (`app/pay/page.tsx`)**
    *   **PayP-1:** Apply the standard page layout structure, including consistent background, padding, and container usage.
    *   **PayP-2:** Ensure the `SubscriptionStatus` component is styled consistently with its appearance on other pages (if applicable) or with the general design system.
    *   **PayP-3:** Verify the `StripeBuyButton` component's appearance integrates smoothly; apply wrapper styles if necessary for alignment or spacing.
    *   **PayP-4:** Restyle the "Subscription Not Available" and "Error Loading" message states to use standard card/alert/notification components and styling.
*   **Update Password Page (`app/update-password/page.tsx`)**
    *   **UP-1:** Redesign the main `Card` component using the standard application card style.
    *   **UP-2:** Standardize the styling of `Input`, `Label`, `Button`, and `Alert` components to match the design system.
    *   **UP-3:** Ensure the icon usage (`KeyRound` within the themed circle) is consistent with icon treatments elsewhere.
*   **Verify Email Page (`app/verify-email/page.tsx`)**
    *   **VE-1:** Redesign the main `Card` component using the standard application card style.
    *   **VE-2:** Standardize the styling of `Button` components (Resend, Back to Login).
    *   **VE-3:** Ensure the icon usage (`Mail` within the themed circle) is consistent with icon treatments elsewhere.
    *   **VE-4:** Style the resend success message/check icon consistently with application success indicators.

**5. Design Considerations**

*   **Component Library:** Primarily utilize existing `shadcn/ui` components and established custom components/variants from the landing page/dashboard implementation. Create new shared components or variants only if necessary.
*   **Styling:** Strictly adhere to the Tailwind CSS configuration and established design tokens (colors, fonts, spacing) from the project. Use utility classes for consistency. Reference styles in `components/landingpage/*` and `app/dashboard/page.tsx` as the source of truth.
*   **Responsiveness:** Employ mobile-first design principles using Tailwind's responsive modifiers (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, etc.). Test thoroughly across breakpoints.
*   **Accessibility:** Use semantic HTML (e.g., `<form>`, `<label>`, `<button>`). Ensure proper `for`/`id` linking in forms. Provide descriptive `alt` text for images and `aria-label` attributes for icon buttons where needed. Test color contrast ratios. Ensure full keyboard navigability and logical focus order.
*   **Micro-interactions:** Apply subtle transitions and hover effects consistent with the landing page components (e.g., button scaling, border color changes) where appropriate, avoiding excessive animation.

**6. Success Metrics**

*   **Visual Audit:** A manual review confirms that the target pages visually align with the design language of the landing page and dashboard (component styles, colors, typography, spacing).
*   **Component Consistency:** Code review confirms the use of established shared components and styling utilities.
*   **Functionality:** All existing authentication, profile update, password reset, verification, and payment flows function correctly after the UI changes.
*   **Responsiveness:** Pages render correctly and are usable across target device resolutions (e.g., 360px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px widths).
*   **Accessibility Audit:** Automated (e.g., Axe, Lighthouse) and manual accessibility checks show no major regressions and adherence to WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines for the updated components.
*   **User Feedback (Optional):** Qualitative feedback indicates improved user satisfaction or perceived ease of use for these flows.
