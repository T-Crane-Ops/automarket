# Product Requirements Document: Profile Page Enhancement

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines requirements for enhancing the user profile page within the AutoMarket application. The goal is to expand the current profile functionality beyond subscription management to include comprehensive user information management capabilities, allowing users to update their personal information, preferences, and account settings while maintaining visual and experiential consistency with the existing design language.

**2. Goals**

* **Enhanced User Information Management:** Expand the profile page to include additional user information fields beyond basic account details, allowing users to maintain a complete profile.
* **Improved Information Organization:** Restructure the profile page to logically group related settings and information for better user experience.
* **Visual Consistency:** Ensure the enhanced profile page adheres to the existing design system and UI patterns established in the application.
* **Streamlined User Experience:** Create intuitive flows for updating user information with appropriate validation and feedback.
* **Accessibility:** Maintain high standards of accessibility across all new interface elements.

**3. Non-Goals**

* Redesigning the subscription management functionality already present on the profile page.
* Changing underlying authentication mechanisms or user data structures.
* Adding social media integration or third-party login management.
* Building user-to-user interaction features (messaging, following, etc.).

**4. User Stories / Requirements**

**4.1. General Profile Enhancement Requirements**

* **PR-1:** As a user, I want to see my profile information organized into logical sections (Personal Information, Account Settings, Preferences, Subscription) for easier navigation and management.
* **PR-2:** As a user, I want clear visual feedback when my profile information is being updated, saved successfully, or encounters errors.
* **PR-3:** As a user, I want to be able to edit different parts of my profile independently without having to submit all changes at once.
* **PR-4:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want all new profile fields and controls to be fully accessible via keyboard navigation and screen readers.

**4.2. Personal Information Section**

* **PI-1:** As a user, I want to add/edit my full name (first name, last name) separate from my account email.
* **PI-2:** As a user, I want to add/edit my profile picture through file upload or URL.
* **PI-3:** As a user, I want to add/edit my phone number with appropriate validation.
* **PI-4:** As a user, I want to add/edit my location information (country, city, zip/postal code).
* **PI-5:** As a user, I want to add a brief bio or personal description to my profile.

**4.3. Account Settings Section**

* **AS-1:** As a user, I want to view and update my email address with appropriate verification.
* **AS-2:** As a user, I want a streamlined way to change my password directly from the profile page.
* **AS-3:** As a user, I want to manage notification preferences (email, in-app) for different types of notifications.
* **AS-4:** As a user, I want to view my account creation date and last login information.
* **AS-5:** As a user, I want an option to download my account data.
* **AS-6:** As a user, I want an option to delete my account with appropriate safeguards.

**4.4. Preferences Section**

* **PRF-1:** As a user, I want to set my preferred language for the application.
* **PRF-2:** As a user, I want to toggle between light and dark mode directly from my profile.
* **PRF-3:** As a user, I want to set my preferred currency for any monetary displays.
* **PRF-4:** As a user, I want to set my time zone to ensure times are displayed appropriately.

**4.5. Subscription Management Section**

* **SM-1:** As a user, I want the current subscription management functionality to be visually integrated with the new profile sections while maintaining all existing features.
* **SM-2:** As a user, I want to see my subscription history (previous plans, payment dates) in an organized timeline.

**5. UI/UX Design Specifications**

**5.1. Layout Structure**

* **Layout-1:** The enhanced profile page should use a tabbed interface with clearly labeled sections (Personal Information, Account Settings, Preferences, Subscription).
* **Layout-2:** Each tab should contain logically grouped form elements with consistent spacing, alignment, and validation patterns.
* **Layout-3:** The page should follow responsive design principles, adapting gracefully from mobile to desktop views:
  * Mobile: Full-width stacked sections with collapsible accordions
  * Tablet: Two-column layout for form fields where appropriate
  * Desktop: Multi-column layout with fixed sidebar navigation

**5.2. Component Design**

* **Component-1:** Use consistent card components (`bg-background/50 backdrop-blur-sm border border-primary/10 rounded-xl p-6`) for each section.
* **Component-2:** Implement form controls using the established UI components:
  * Text inputs, dropdowns, and toggles from the shadcn/ui library
  * Consistent labeling, placeholder text, and error messages
  * Appropriate use of icons from the Lucide React library
* **Component-3:** Profile picture upload should include:
  * Current image display with appropriate fallback for new users
  * Upload button with drag-and-drop functionality
  * Simple image cropping/editing functionality
  * Preview before saving
* **Component-4:** Add contextual help tooltips for complex settings using consistent iconography and positioning.
* **Component-5:** Use skeleton loaders during data fetching states to maintain layout structure.
* **Component-6:** Implement success/error notifications using the existing Alert component system.

**5.3. Interaction Design**

* **Interaction-1:** All editable fields should have clear visual indicators of their editable state.
* **Interaction-2:** Form sections should save independently to avoid requiring users to update all profile information at once.
* **Interaction-3:** Implement progressive disclosure for complex settings or dangerous actions (like account deletion).
* **Interaction-4:** Add appropriate transition animations for tab switching, form submission states, and notifications that match the existing application style.
* **Interaction-5:** Ensure hover/focus states for all interactive elements are consistent with established patterns.
* **Interaction-6:** Implement automatic validation with informative error messages before form submission.

**5.4. Visual Design**

* **Visual-1:** Maintain the established color scheme, typography, and spacing system from the existing profile page.
* **Visual-2:** Use consistent iconography from the Lucide React library throughout the interface.
* **Visual-3:** Implement subtle visual hierarchy through spacing, typography weight/size, and background treatments.
* **Visual-4:** Use appropriate visual feedback for different states (loading, success, error, disabled).
* **Visual-5:** Ensure all text and interactive elements meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast requirements.

**6. Technical Implementation Considerations**

* **Tech-1:** Create reusable form section components that can be independently updated to simplify the UI and improve performance.
* **Tech-2:** Implement client-side validation using existing form validation libraries/patterns.
* **Tech-3:** Use optimistic UI updates where appropriate, with proper fallback for error states.
* **Tech-4:** Implement proper image upload handling with client-side validation for file types and sizes.
* **Tech-5:** Ensure all new profile fields are properly typed and validated on both client and server.
* **Tech-6:** Add appropriate schema updates for new user profile fields in the database.

**7. Success Metrics**

* **Metric-1:** Increased profile completion rate (percentage of users who complete their extended profile information).
* **Metric-2:** Reduced support tickets related to users wanting to update their information.
* **Metric-3:** Improved user satisfaction scores in relation to account management.
* **Metric-4:** High success rate for profile update operations (low error rate).
* **Metric-5:** Accessibility compliance maintained across all new interface elements.

**8. Implementation Phases**
