# Profile Page Enhancement Implementation

This document provides an overview of the implementation details for the enhanced profile page based on the requirements outlined in the [Product Requirements Document](./docs/prd-profile-enhancement.md).

## Overview

The enhanced profile page implementation includes:

1. A new database table `user_profiles` to store additional user information
2. A tabbed interface with four sections:
   - Personal Information
   - Account Settings
   - Preferences
   - Subscription
3. File upload capabilities for profile pictures
4. New API endpoints for managing profile data

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Run the Database Migration

First, run the database migration to create the necessary tables and policies in your Supabase database:

```bash
npm run migrate:profiles
```

This script will:
- Create the `user_profiles` table
- Set up Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Create a `profiles` storage bucket for avatar images
- Set up appropriate storage policies
- Create profiles for existing users

### 2. Using the Enhanced Profile Page

The enhanced profile page is already integrated into the application. When you visit `/profile`, you'll see the new tabbed interface with all the enhanced functionality.

## Implementation Details

### Components Structure

The implementation follows the structure outlined in the PRD:

- `EnhancedProfilePage` - Main container with tabbed interface
  - `PersonalInfoForm` - Form for personal information and profile picture
    - `ProfilePictureUploader` - Component for uploading and managing profile pictures
  - `AccountSettingsForm` - Form for account settings and notification preferences
  - `PreferencesForm` - Form for language, theme, currency, and timezone preferences
  - Subscription Component - Existing subscription management functionality

### Database Schema

The `user_profiles` table includes the following fields:

- `id` - Primary key (UUID)
- `user_id` - Foreign key to the Supabase auth.users table
- `first_name`, `last_name`, `display_name` - Name information
- `bio` - User biography
- `avatar_url` - URL to the profile picture
- `phone_number`, `country`, `city`, `postal_code` - Contact and location information
- `language`, `currency`, `timezone`, `theme_preference` - User preferences
- `notification_preferences` - JSON object with notification settings
- `created_at`, `updated_at` - Timestamps

### API Endpoints

- `GET /api/user/profile` - Fetch the user's profile
- `PUT /api/user/profile` - Update the user's profile

### File Storage

Profile pictures are stored in the Supabase Storage service under the `profiles` bucket. Each user's avatars are stored in a folder with their user ID as the name to maintain proper isolation.

## Further Development

Potential future enhancements could include:

1. Activity history and logs
2. Social media integration
3. Two-factor authentication settings
4. Enhanced privacy settings
5. Public profile options

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the profile page, try the following:

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify network requests to the API endpoints
3. Make sure you have the correct Supabase policies in place
4. Ensure the Storage bucket is properly configured
